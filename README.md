# CSC311
This repository contains all of my work for CSC311: Intro to ML at UofT.

I was fortunate to receive 20/20 and 35/36 for A1 and A2, respectively, and I dropped the course before my marks for A3 are out, due to my slight disagreement with the course structure. ;(

Sadly, my journey to ML ends here for now. To whoever is looking at this however, I sincerely hope that you can succeed in the course, and that my works can help along the process. 

Best wishes and good luck!
