# CSC311
This repository contains all of my work for CSC311: Intro to ML at UofT.

I think the previous 2 assignments all ended pretty well, and very unfortunately due to some personal issues I had to withdraw from the course before seeing how I did for A3. My journey to ML ends here for now. To whoever is looking at this however, I sincerely hope that you can succeed in the course, and that my works can help along the process. 

Best wishes and good luck!
