# CSC311
This repository contains all of my work for CSC311: Intro to ML at UofT.

I was fortunate to receive 20/20 and 35/36 for A1 and A2, respectively, and I dropped the course before my marks for A3 are out, due to my slight disagreement with the course structure. ;(

Below is my little rant about the course:
In my experience, the course was incredibly theoretical for a first course in ML, and there seems to be very little attention given to practical applications. I spent tremendous efforts trying to bridge the gap, but time is indeed ... scarce. Perhaps this is not the majority's opinion, but I sincerely hope that in future offerings of the course, there could be walkthroughs of code/algorithms, and the logical reasonings behind them. 

Due to numerous constraints, sadly, my journey ends here. To whoever is looking at this, however, I sincerely hope that you can succeed in the course, and that my works can help along the process.
